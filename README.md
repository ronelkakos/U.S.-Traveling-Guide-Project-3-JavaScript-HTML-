# U.S. Traveling Guide Project 3 (JavaScript & HTML)

(Created and finished in early May of 2024)

My third and final project in a JavaScript course, where I added onto Project One and Project Two website (both on my GitHub) by adding a FAQ portion (Frequently Asked Questions) onto the third page. The FAQ portion involves a series of frequently asked questions about guidance and vacationing Orlando, Florida. Overall, the website has different JavaScript functions such as a budget calculator with tax accounted for, choosing from selection choices, displaying current date on the last page of the site along with a form to fill out that requires you to fill out the important portions on the form. Overall the website serves as a guide to visiting the three major cities mentioned on the site along with different images shown on those cities and activities. Enjoy viewing the website!

To view the website easily and quickly without having to download files, here is a link I created to click below to an easy access in viewing my site through raw.githack.com.
