# U.S. Traveling Guide Project 3 (JavaScript & HTML)

(Created and finished in early May of 2024)

My third and final project in a JavaScript course, where I added onto Project One and Project Two website (both on my GitHub) by adding a FAQ portion (Frequently Asked Questions) onto the third page. The FAQ portion involves a series of frequently asked questions about guidance and vacationing Orlando, Florida. Enjoy viewing the website!

To view the website easily and quickly without having to download files, here is a link I created to click below to an easy access in viewing my site through raw.githack.com.
